1.	We'll be creating a game of hangman between a server and a client. We will be
	 using standard C networking libraries to implement a server and a client. We 
	will implement hangman itself on the server side.

2.	We anticipate that getting the clients to talk to each other through the 
	server will be the most challenging part.

3.	a) StackOverflow
	b) The textbook
	c)	Lecture slides

4. due to other class projects having sooner due dates, this project is on the 
	backburner until those are complete. As soon as we're both free, OR 
	the Tuesday before hits, we'll work on it maniacally until it's complete.
