2. Disconnects are not handled gracefully, when either client disconnects the other will most likely error and exit. On timeouts, one client isn't notified and the other client will loop infinitely. If the game is played without timing out, then it will work as expected. Given more time, we would have tackled these two issues in particular, hopefully getting timeouts to work as expected.
3. We ran our code with multiple sessions and multiple clients and saw that it was almost working as expected. The only issues arose when we waited too long to guess or when clients unexpectedly quit. We attempted to handle as many of the edge cases as possible, which helped some, but unfortunately ran out of time.
4. The hardest part of this assignment was using a linked list to store all of the guessed words, then using that list to validate incoming guesses. Getting string comparisons to work as expected with null bytes that may, or may not, be present was a real challenge.
